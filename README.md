# Plazza

Plazza is a restaurant simulation program, where each kitchen is represented by a a different process, and where each kitchen's cooks are represented by a thread.

It therefore involves handling inter process communication (IPC) as well a process and threads managment.

Load balancing is also a major aspect of the project, so that orders will be dispatched according to opened kitchens workloads, and new kitchens have to be created when the existing ones can't handle the charge.
